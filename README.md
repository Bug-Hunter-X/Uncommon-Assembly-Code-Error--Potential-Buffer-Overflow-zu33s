This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code.  The bug demonstrates an unsafe memory access that could lead to program crashes or security exploits if the values of EBX and ECX are not carefully controlled.  The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this risk using array bounds checking.
